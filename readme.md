# xp3-tool

A simple set of tools for packing and unpacking XP3 archives, which are commonly used in visual novel engines like Kirikiri and Kirikiroid2.

## Overview

This project contains two components:
- **xp3-packer**: Packs a directory into an XP3 archive.
- **xp3-unpacker**: Extracts the contents of an XP3 archive into a directory.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust & Cargo:**  
  Make sure you have [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed. Cargo, Rustâ€™s package manager, is included with the installation.

## Building the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd storycraft-xp3-tool
   ```

2. **Build in Release Mode:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
   This will generate the executables in the `target/release/` directory:
   - On Linux/macOS: `xp3-packer` and `xp3-unpacker`
   - On Windows: `xp3-packer.exe` and `xp3-unpacker.exe`

## Usage

### Unpacking an XP3 Archive
